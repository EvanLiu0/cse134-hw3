      <p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Provide a means of allowing zoo visitors to keep track of the exhibits
          that they want to see during their trip
        </li>
        <li>
          Generate optimized routes to take visitors through each of their
          selected exhibits in as little time as possible
        </li>
        <li>
          Create visual displays of the qualitative results on each page to
          summarize found identity

      <p><strong>Primary User Interfaces</strong></p>
      <p>
        The following user interfaces, whose functions are outlined below, were
        constructed using Android Studio. <br />While the implementation details
        of each cannot be expanded upon due to academic integrity concerns, both
        user interfaces rely on frontends composed primarily of HTML-like tags
        and CSS-like styling, as well as backends that utilize calls to a local
        database to store and retrieve user data, as well as those of the zoo's
        exhibits. The optimized directions found in the second figure below are
        generated according to a recursive, greedy graph traversal algorithm
        that charts every possible route between two exhibits and returns the
        one with the lowest weight.
